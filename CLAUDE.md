## Master Context Policy (Single-File Workflow)
`CLAUDE.md` is the single master operating brief for Claude work in this repo.

The docs below are still kept for traceability and deep reference, but their
core directives are consolidated here:

- `docs/REPO-OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md`
- `docs/context/README.md`
- `docs/context/project/*`
- `docs/context/strategy/*`
- `docs/context/repo/*`
- `docs/archive/outputs/marketing-strategy-service.md`

Conflict rule:
1. Runtime code and data (`app/`, `components/`, `data/`, `lib/`) win.
2. This `CLAUDE.md` file is the default instruction layer.
3. Archived/context docs are reference material unless this file explicitly
   elevates a rule from them.

### Consolidated Strategy Snapshot
- Positioning: **high strategic depth + high technical depth** for SMB buyers.
- Core commercial frame: strategy + implementation + measurement under one
  accountable owner.
- Priority buyer sequence:
  1. Burned Founder
  2. Scaling Operator
  3. Tech-Confused CMO
  4. Ambitious Newcomer
- Offer ladder: audit -> foundation/build-out -> retainer.
- Delivery model for strategy-led engagements (from archived strategy draft):
  - Phase 1: Audit and strategy (`4-8 weeks`)
  - Phase 2: Build and execution (ongoing)
- Pricing guardrails (outcome-based, never hourly):
  - Audit entry: `$1.5k-$5k` (MarTech Audit anchor: `$2k-$5k`)
  - Foundation/build projects: `$4k-$30k+` depending on scope
  - Retainers: `$3.5k-$12k/month` depending on engagement model
- Messaging hierarchy for commercial pages:
  1. Business problem
  2. Why alternatives failed
  3. What Darling MarTech does differently
  4. Proof
  5. Offer-specific CTA

### Consolidated IA / Page Strategy Snapshot
- Live core pages: `/`, `/services`, `/services/[slug]`, `/work`,
  `/work/[slug]`, `/tools`, `/tools/[slug]`, `/tools/cmo-simulator`, `/about`,
  `/contact`, `/studio`, `/process`.
- `/lab` is legacy — permanent redirects to `/tools/*` are in place. `/lab` is
  not a public concept. Do not reference `/lab` routes in new work.
- `/tools` role: self-serve strategy layer. Three visitor utilities — CMO Simulator,
  GEO Readiness Auditor, CMO Roadmap Generator — that deliver immediate value and
  qualify prospects in the process. Not a portfolio. Not a build archive. Not proof.
  `/tools` is where a prospect runs their own strategy session and walks out with both
  an artifact and a reason to call.
- `/work` role: proof of capability — client builds with measurable outcomes.
  A prospect evaluates these; they do not use them. Curated, not exhaustive.
  Work index layout: flagship studies first, supporting grid, connected-system strips
  under parents, then a restrained studio strip (horizontal track). Flagship block
  includes a short editorial intro label; supporting cards use a compact layout (one
  primary metric, minimal footer chrome). Studio carousel does not auto-advance;
  horizontal scroll is confined to the track (no document `scrollIntoView`) so smooth
  scroll (Lenis) is not hijacked.
- Phase 3D classification decisions (2026-03-28):
  - Core tools (permanent, primary): CMO Simulator, GEO Readiness Auditor,
    CMO Roadmap Generator. These are the only entries on `/tools`.
  - Removed from `/tools` index: Graston Growth Engine, Barbershop Command Center,
    Smart Sales & Pricing Tool, Investment ROI Planner, Clinical Compass,
    License Requirements Navigator. These are `/work` entries — client builds, not
    visitor utilities. Orphaned `/tools/[slug]` routes for these should redirect to
    their corresponding `/work/[slug]` pages.
  - Removed entirely: PRO DJ Studio, Strum AI. Personal builds with no client
    connection. Not surfaced on `/tools`. No work equivalent — these can 404 or
    redirect to `/tools`.
- Tool access model (Phase 3D):
  - CMO Simulator: dedicated route `/tools/cmo-simulator` with detail page + launch modal.
    This is the target pattern for any future tool requiring SEO or explanation.
  - GEO Readiness Auditor + CMO Roadmap Generator: modal/iframe launch from `/tools` index.
    No dynamic `/tools/[slug]` route. If detail pages are warranted later, add them as
    hand-crafted static routes — not a generic dynamic route.
  - No `app/tools/[slug]/` dynamic route. Tools are too few and too different to template.
- Planned priority pages/routes:
  - child-service money pages under current service parents
  - `/industries/[slug]` after child service pages
  - `/pricing` later
- Batch 1 child-service execution (complete 2026-04-01): `fractional-cmo`, `website-strategy`,
  `crm-architecture`, `local-seo`, `conversion-optimization` — all shipped with copy + linking + proof alignment.
- Confirmed Batch 2 build order (post-consolidation audit 2026-04-01; Batch 1 lightweight visual support complete 2026-04-01):
  1. `martech-audit`
  2. `agentic-marketing-systems`
  3. `geo-optimization` (nested canonical route; specialty relative to Batch 1 growth pages)
- Sub-service routes: plain-English slugs under `/services/[slug]`. See `service-route-and-slug-conventions.md`.
- Internal linking minimums:
  - Every service page: link to `/contact` + at least 2 relevant work pages.
  - Every work page: link to the service page it proves (Batch 1 flagship pairings use `primaryServicePageSlug` on `work-index` entries → one contextual link on the work detail hero from `WorkDetailContent`).
  - Every tools page: exactly 1 primary service link + 1 supporting work link.
- Homepage/services alignment rule:
  - Hero carries the core positioning load (problem + promise + model).
  - Services section frames problem clusters and routes to child pages — not a repeat of the hero.
  - `<AboutTeaser />` is removed from the homepage (`app/page.tsx`). Do not recreate it or its
    job in any other homepage section. The hero now carries the full positioning load.
  - Homepage flow (implemented): Hero → Services → FeaturedTool → CaseStudies → Testimonials → ContactCTA.
  - Hero primary CTA routes to `/work`. Secondary CTA routes to `/contact?intent=unsure`.
  - Services section headline and card summaries are problem-led (updated 2026-03-29).
  - Consult `docs/context/project/service-pages/homepage-hero-and-services-alignment.md` before
    changing the hero or services section.

### Contact / Intake Flow Strategy (Phase 4E-2, 2026-03-29)
**Role of `/contact`:** Qualified consultation request screen. Not a general
inquiry form. Its job is to convert a pre-qualified visitor into a replied-to
conversation with enough context for Jacob to respond usefully within 24 hours.

**Intake model: Two-step progressive disclosure**
- Step 1 — Intent selector tiles (4 options, not a dropdown):
  1. "I know what I need" — from services, has a clear ask
  2. "I saw something in your work" — proof-driven visitor
  3. "I just ran a tool" — has a tool artifact, wants next steps
  4. "I'm not sure yet" — exploring, low-confidence
- Step 2 — Minimal form, fields adapted by selected tile

**Minimum fields (always):** name, email, primary challenge (free text)
**Optional always:** company / website
**Conditional:** service dropdown (only if tile = "I know what I need");
  short tool-output field (only if tile = "I just ran a tool")
**Never ask up front:** budget, timeline, project type

**Query param routing:** Accept `?intent=` to pre-select a tile on arrival.
Use these across the site:
  - `/tools` post-tool CTA → `/contact?intent=tool`
  - Service/audit CTAs → `/contact?intent=service`
  - `/work` detail CTAs → `/contact?intent=work`
  - General exploratory CTAs → `/contact?intent=unsure`

**Post-submit:** Stay on-page (swap form for success state). Success state
confirms the action and response promise, then offers one next-step link based
on intent:
  - service intent → `/work` ("See relevant work")
  - work intent → `/work` ("Explore all case studies")
  - tool intent → `/tools` ("Revisit the tools")
  - unsure intent → `/process` ("See how I run these conversations")

**Page structure:** Short positioning line → intent tiles → minimal form →
trust micro-copy under submit ("No pitch. Just a real conversation.") →
email escape valve at bottom. No hero, no 3D scene. Contact page closes;
other pages sell.

**Implementation scope:** ✅ Fully implemented via `ContactForm.tsx` + `app/contact/page.tsx`
+ `/api/contact/route.ts`. API supports: `intent`, `service`, `toolOutput` fields.
No additional routes, data files, or API routes required.

### Service Page System (2026-04-01 — foundation pass complete)

> Canonical planning and implementation docs now live in `docs/context/project/service-pages/`.
> Consult that folder before any `/services` or child-service page work.

#### Batch 1 canonical child-service slugs (foundation normalized 2026-04-01)

These 5 slugs are now clean in `data/services.ts` and resolve via the dynamic route:

- `fractional-cmo` — Fractional CMO & Embedded Marketing Leadership
- `website-strategy` — Website Strategy & Rebuilds (**new** — canonical Batch 1 entry)
- `crm-architecture` — CRM Architecture & Marketing Systems (**new**)
- `local-seo` — Local SEO & Search Visibility (**new**)
- `conversion-optimization` — Conversion Optimization (**new**)

Additional standalone entries remain in `standaloneServicePages` with their own routes.
**Next-tier priorities (Batch 2, in order):** `martech-audit`, `agentic-marketing-systems`,
`geo-optimization`. **Valid but de-emphasized in related-service surfacing (consolidation audit 2026-04-01):**
`website-redesign-conversion-ux` (conceptual overlap with `website-strategy` + `conversion-optimization`;
related links now point to those Batch 1 pages), `the-conductor` (legacy/internal naming; related links
now point to Batch 1 growth/measurement-adjacent pages), `brand-strategy` (real offer; related links
now favor Batch 1 siblings over parent-category filler). **`the-fortress`** stays a nested systems proof
page. These are not treated as conflicting with Batch 1 — routes stay live; emphasis is via linking and
cluster choices, not deletion.

#### Service data architecture (current)

- `serviceDetails` — 6 parent service entries (strategy, brand-web, systems, growth, commerce, specialized)
- `standaloneServicePages` — 11 standalone entries including all 5 Batch 1 slugs
- `allServicePages` — combined array used by `getServicePageBySlug()` and `generateServiceStaticParams()`
- Optional **proof visual support** on any service page: `supportImagePublicId`, `supportImageAlt`, `supportImageCaption`, `supportImageWorkSlug` (Cloudinary-first, one image max; Batch 1 entries populated per `service-visual-support-map.json`)
- `generateServiceStaticParams()` excludes entries with a nested `routePath` — those 4 entries
  (`geo-optimization`, `agentic-marketing-systems`, `the-fortress`, `the-conductor`) use nested routes
  and are intentionally excluded from the flat `[slug]` dynamic route

#### ServiceDetailPage.tsx template sections (as of 2026-04-01)

The component now renders these sections in order when data is present:

1. Back nav + parent breadcrumb
2. Hero (eyebrow, H1, tagline, summary, CTA)
3. Pricing signal (optional)
4. **Proof visual support** (optional — one Cloudinary image + caption + link to `/work/[slug]` when `supportImagePublicId` + `supportImageAlt` are set; Batch 1 pages populated; subordinate to proof cards below)
5. Proof stats / audit snapshot (optional)
6. **Signs you need this** (optional — `signsYouNeedIt?: string[]`)
7. **What this usually includes** (deliverables list)
8. **Common questions** FAQ accordion (optional — `faqItems?: FaqItem[]`)
9. **Related proof** (proof grid linking to work pages)
10. Proof tool card (optional)
11. Related case studies (optional — from `proofWorkSlugs`)
12. Featured offers / child services (optional — parent pages only)
13. Related services (optional)
14. Tag row
15. CTA strip

The `signsYouNeedIt` and `faqItems` fields are new — they are optional and gracefully
absent for existing entries. Fill them in the copywriting pass for each Batch 1 page.

#### Stale references fixed (2026-04-01)

- `systems` parent proof card: `/lab` href → `/work/graston-growth-engine`
- `fractional-cmo` standalone: `externalCtaHref` `/lab/cmo-simulator` → `/tools/cmo-simulator`

#### Page-role logic

- **Homepage** — orient the right buyer fast; hero carries the core positioning load
- **Services index** — explain problem clusters and route users to the right child page
- **Sub-service pages** — explain one service clearly enough to convert the right buyer
- **Work pages** — prove capability
- **Tools** — immediate value / self-diagnosis
- **Contact** — qualified conversation request

#### Layered writing rule

Service pages must move through content in this order:

1. Plain-English buyer language (what is broken, what this fixes, why it matters)
2. Strategic translator language (how strategy, systems, execution, and growth connect)
3. Technical / specialist language (architecture, automation, CRM, SEO, tooling specifics)

Do not reverse this order. Do not ask visitors to choose a knowledge level. Translate complexity instead.

#### CTA rule

- Default child-service CTA: `/contact?intent=service`
- Supporting CTA: one relevant `/work` proof page
- Tool link: only when naturally relevant to the service — not forced

#### Proof assignment rule

Use `service-proof-matrix.md` first when assigning proof to a service page:

- One dominant proof item per service page
- Supporting proof only when it adds range or mechanism clarity
- Do not attach weak or visually similar but strategically irrelevant proof

#### Build sequence

- ✅ Foundation pass complete (2026-04-01) — data layer, route integrity, template structure
- ✅ `/services/fractional-cmo` copywriting pass complete (2026-04-01) — Batch 1, page 1
  - Summary rewritten following layered writing rule (plain-English buyer → strategic → operational)
  - 7 `signsYouNeedIt` bullets added (diagnostic, symptom-led)
  - 5 `faqItems` added (what is it, vs agency, implementation scope, small teams, engagement length)
  - Deliverables tightened — more specific and commercially legible
  - Proof reordered: **Graston Technique is primary** (strategy + systems), Pike Medical supporting (long-term CMO stewardship)
  - `proofWorkSlugs`: `['graston-technique', 'pike-medical-consultants']`
  - `secondaryCtaHref`: `/work/graston-technique`
  - CMO Simulator remains as `proofTools` — supporting tool, not primary CTA
  - `relatedServiceSlugs` (linking pass): `['website-strategy', 'crm-architecture']`
- ✅ `/services/website-strategy` copywriting pass complete (2026-04-01) — Batch 1, page 2
  - Summary rewritten following layered writing rule (buyer problem → strategic model → how it works)
  - 7 `signsYouNeedIt` bullets added (symptom-led, buyer-recognizable)
  - 5 `faqItems` added (rebuild vs refresh, platform compatibility, content/structure scope, measuring success, site size)
  - Deliverables tightened — 6 items focused on strategy, hierarchy, trust, and conversion path
  - Proof reordered: **Pike Medical Consultants is primary** (trust + healthcare rebuild), Tuohy Bailey & Moore supporting (trust-led redesign), Riley Bennett Egloff supporting (long-term stewardship)
  - `proofWorkSlugs`: `['pike-medical-consultants', 'tuohy-bailey-moore', 'riley-bennett-egloff']`
  - `secondaryCtaHref`: `/work/pike-medical-consultants`
  - `relatedServiceSlugs` (linking pass): `['conversion-optimization', 'fractional-cmo']`
- ✅ `/services/crm-architecture` copywriting pass complete (2026-04-01) — Batch 1, page 3
  - Summary rewritten following layered writing rule (CRM is live but not trusted → structure problem → systems model)
  - 7 `signsYouNeedIt` bullets added (symptom-led: trust, stages, manual follow-up, reporting, ownership, data quality, usability)
  - 5 `faqItems` added (what is CRM architecture, current platform, build vs recommend, CRM vs sales-process, team size)
  - Deliverables tightened — 6 items: audit, lifecycle/pipeline design, routing/handoff, field cleanup, automation logic, dashboard visibility
  - Tagline updated to be more buyer-direct ("Having a CRM is not the same as having a system you can actually run from.")
  - Proof hierarchy: **Graston Growth Engine is primary** (full-stack systems proof), Barbershop Command Center supporting (operational integration); redundant Graston Technique parent card removed in proof-alignment pass so the CRM story stays centered on the Growth Engine + ops proof.
  - `proofWorkSlugs` updated: `['graston-growth-engine', 'barbershop-command-center']`
  - `relatedServiceSlugs` (linking pass): `['fractional-cmo', 'conversion-optimization']`
  - `proofTools` retained (Graston Growth Engine live demo card)
- ✅ `/services/local-seo` copywriting pass complete (2026-04-01) — Batch 1, page 4
  - Summary rewritten following layered writing rule (local visibility underperforms → trust + structure problem → strategic model)
  - Tagline updated to be more specific ("easier to find — and easier to trust")
  - 7 `signsYouNeedIt` bullets added (symptom-led: competitor visibility, Google Business, weak action rate, thin pages, unclear priorities, offline/online gap, trust signals not working together)
  - 5 `faqItems` added (what local SEO includes, vs technical SEO, location pages, timeline, traffic already exists)
  - Deliverables tightened — 6 items: audit, page direction, Google Business/local signals, internal linking/content priorities, review/trust strategy, measurement
  - Proof hierarchy: **Russell Painting is primary** (trust + local search lead engine), Hoosier Boy Barbershop supporting (#1 local search), Pike Medical supporting (multi-location)
  - `proofWorkSlugs` updated: `['russell-painting', 'hoosier-boy-barbershop', 'pike-medical-consultants']`
  - `relatedServiceSlugs` (linking pass): `['website-strategy', 'conversion-optimization']`
- ✅ `/services/conversion-optimization` copywriting pass complete (2026-04-01) — Batch 1, page 5 (final)
  - Summary rewritten following layered writing rule (buyer gap → friction/trust/path diagnosis → structural operating model)
  - Tagline updated to be more buyer-direct ("The right people are already arriving. The question is why they are leaving without acting.")
  - 7 `signsYouNeedIt` bullets added (symptom-led: traffic/action gap, unclear next steps, clunky flows, mobile weakness, demand leakage, adding traffic before fixing path, unfocused pages)
  - 5 `faqItems` added (redesign vs optimization, improving without full rebuild, measuring success, not just ecommerce, what causes weak conversion)
  - Deliverables tightened — 6 items: conversion-path audit, action hierarchy review, form/flow review, trust/reassurance review, page-level priorities, implementation roadmap
  - Proof hierarchy: **317 BBQ is primary** (40% conversion lift — direct conversion-path proof), Pike Medical supporting (trust + patient acquisition), Hoosier Boy Barbershop supporting (booking flow rebuild)
  - `proofWorkSlugs`: `['317-bbq', 'hoosier-boy-barbershop', 'pike-medical-consultants']`
  - `secondaryCtaHref`: `/work/317-bbq`
  - `relatedServiceSlugs` (linking pass): `['website-strategy', 'local-seo', 'crm-architecture']`
- **Batch 1 child-service build is now complete.** All 5 pages have been implemented with full copywriting passes.
- ✅ **Parent/child linking pass complete (2026-04-01)** — `data/services.ts` + `ServicesExperience.tsx` + `ServiceDetailPage.tsx`
  - Parent `childServiceSlugs` now surface Batch 1 children per `parent-child-linking-kit.json` (`brand-web` → `website-strategy` + `conversion-optimization`; `systems` leads with `crm-architecture`; `growth` → `local-seo` + `conversion-optimization` + `geo-optimization`; `strategy` unchanged → `fractional-cmo`).
  - Batch 1 `relatedServiceSlugs` trimmed to 2–3 strategic siblings per kit (no parent-id noise in related lists).
  - Standalone breadcrumb parent: when a slug appears under more than one parent `childServiceSlugs`, the UI prefers the parent whose `layer` matches the page (`conversion-optimization` → `growth`, not `brand-web`).
  - `/services` cluster links: broken placeholder slugs now target real routes (`brand-strategy`, `martech-audit`, `geo-optimization`, `agentic-marketing-systems`).
- ✅ **Proof alignment + work→service backlinks (2026-04-01)** — `data/services.ts`, `data/work/work-index.ts`, `lib/work.ts`, `app/work/[slug]/page.tsx`, `WorkDetailContent.tsx`
  - Batch 1 service proof stacks checked against `service-proof-snippets.json`: **CRM Architecture** dropped a redundant third proof card (Graston Technique parent) so supporting proof stays subordinate to **Graston Growth Engine** + Barbershop Command Center; `secondaryCtaLabel` clarified for the Growth Engine URL.
  - Flagship work cards set `primaryServicePageSlug` for the strongest pairings: Graston Technique → `fractional-cmo`, Pike Medical → `website-strategy`, Graston Growth Engine → `crm-architecture`, Russell Painting → `local-seo`, 317 BBQ → `conversion-optimization`. Work detail renders a single “This build supports …” link to the resolved service route (respects `routePath` when present).
- ✅ **Post-Batch-1 service-system consolidation audit (2026-04-01)** — Confirmed next-tier Batch 2 order
  (`martech-audit` → `agentic-marketing-systems` → `geo-optimization`). Confirmed de-emphasis strategy for
  `website-redesign-conversion-ux`, `the-conductor`, and `brand-strategy` (narrow `relatedServiceSlugs`
  updates in `data/services.ts` only; no `/services` layout or Batch 1 copy changes). `/services` cluster
  links unchanged: `brand-strategy` still appears twice with different labels (positioning vs identity);
  legacy combo slug is not cluster-featured.
- ✅ **Batch 1 lightweight visual support (2026-04-01)** — `ServiceDetailPage` renders one optional proof-led image block when `supportImage*` fields are set; all five Batch 1 child pages populated (Cloudinary public IDs, captions from visual-support map, work slugs aligned with primary proof — no `proofWorkSlugs` changes). **Next likely phase:** Batch 2 first page `martech-audit`, then `agentic-marketing-systems`, then `geo-optimization` (order unchanged above).

### Consolidated Proof / Taxonomy Snapshot
- Top reusable proof assets: Graston Technique, Pike Medical, PrimaryCare Indy,
  UrgentCare Indy, 317 BBQ, Hoosier Boy, Riley Bennett Egloff, Tuohy Bailey &
  Moore, Behr Pet, Russell Painting, Primary Colours.
- Highest-leverage proof metrics to reuse:
  - `+212% qualified leads`
  - `95% overhead reduction`
  - `48 hrs/week saved`
  - `45% patient growth over 3 years`
  - `300% organic traffic growth`
  - `75% more bookings`
  - `40% conversion lift`
- Proof routing rule: every `/work/[slug]` and `/tools/[slug]` should map to a
  primary parent service and explicit CTA destination.

### Consolidated Repo Hygiene Snapshot (2026-03-28)
- Canonical content/data lives in `data/` only. Do not recreate root-level
  mirrors like old `services.ts`, `labs.ts`, or `work-*.ts`.
- Generated artifacts stay untracked and local (`.next/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`,
  temporary exports).
- Root should stay lean: runtime/config entry points plus
  `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Strategy and planning docs belong in `docs/context/` or `docs/archive/`,
  not repo root.

### Consolidated Ops / Sync Snapshot
- `docs/context/repo/2026-03-27-claude-os-audit-report.md` is an operations
  sync reference, not runtime product behavior guidance.
- Prioritized sync tiers from that report:
  - Tier 1: Revenue and client delivery artifacts
  - Tier 2: Website and brand assets
  - Tier 3: Job-search and operational docs
  - Tier 4: Knowledge base archives
- Maintenance cadence from that report:
  - Tier 1 daily/weekly
  - Tier 2 weekly/bi-weekly
  - Tier 3 weekly/monthly
  - Tier 4 monthly/as needed

## Tools and Skills Map
Last updated: 2026-03-28

### Purpose
This section tells Claude how to use local context, connectors, and project
skills for Darling MarTech.

Goals:
- reduce unnecessary tool chaining
- reduce token waste
- keep work grounded in local repo and project docs
- use the most direct source of truth for each task

### Tool Use Hierarchy
Use tools and skills in this order:
1. Local project files
2. Project memory files (if present)
3. Project documentation in `docs/`
4. Project-specific skills
5. External connectors only when necessary
6. Live-site/browser verification only when explicitly requested

If the answer exists in repo files or docs, do not use external connectors.

### Primary Working Context

#### Filesystem
Use for:
- reading and editing repo files
- inspecting routes, components, content files, and docs
- understanding current implementation
- making precise changes with minimal exploration

#### Main Darling MarTech repo folder
Primary source of truth for:
- application routes
- page content
- service architecture
- work/tools structures
- shared UI components
- internal linking patterns
- local content/data sources

#### Memory files (if present in workspace)
Candidate memory files:
- `MEMORY.md`
- `project_darling_martech_site_state.md`
- `project_darling_martech_skills.md`

Use for:
- current project status
- known decisions
- active priorities
- continuity across sessions

Do not override these casually without a clear reason.

#### Project docs
Use these docs before inferring architecture from partial code reads:
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/REPO-OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md`
- `docs/context/README.md`
- `docs/context/project/project_darling_martech_repo_map.md`
- `docs/context/project/project_darling_martech_service_architecture.md`
- `docs/context/project/project_darling_martech_work_taxonomy.md`

- `docs/context/project/project_darling_martech_page_briefs.md`
- `docs/context/project/project_darling_martech_offers_and_packaging.md`
- `docs/context/project/project_darling_martech_voice_and_messaging.md`
- `docs/context/project/project_darling_martech_case_studies.md`
- `docs/context/strategy/2026-03-19-competitor-analysis.md`
- `docs/context/strategy/2026-03-19-value-proposition.md`
- `docs/context/repo/2026-03-27-claude-os-audit-report.md`

- `docs/context/project/service-pages/service-proof-matrix.md`
- `docs/context/project/service-pages/ai-builder-operating-rules.md`
- `docs/context/project/service-pages/*` — full service-page system (consult before any `/services` work)

### Connector Policy
External connectors are secondary. Use only when necessary for the task.

#### Vercel
Use for:
- deployment verification
- environment/project checks
- confirming live deployment status
- checking what is live when explicitly requested

Do not use for:
- reconstructing code that already exists locally
- inferring page structure when route files are available
- repeated recovery attempts if access fails

#### Claude in Chrome
Use for:
- explicit live-site verification
- checking rendered behavior
- validating published content/UI when requested
- confirming what users currently see on live site

Do not use for:
- reading code that exists locally
- reverse-engineering structure from browser when repo files are available
- repeated scraping attempts when local context is sufficient

#### Notion
Use for:
- project notes/documents that live only in Notion
- strategy references when requested
- planning material not present in repo

Do not use if same information exists locally.

#### Supabase
Use for:
- schema/table/database tasks
- data model review
- backend data checks tied to implementation

Do not use for general site structure/content work unless task is data-related.

#### Cloudinary
Use for:
- media/asset organization
- image delivery/reference workflows
- asset management tasks

Do not use unless task is specifically about media/assets.

#### Gmail
Use for email workflows only when explicitly requested.

#### Google Calendar
Use for scheduling only when explicitly requested.

#### Zapier
Use for automation/integration tasks only.
Do not use as a fallback research tool.

#### Desktop Commander
Use only for local system operations not covered by normal file context.

#### Windows-MCP
Use only for machine/system tasks when explicitly needed.

#### Three.js 3D Viewer
Use only when working on 3D assets/previews.

### Connector Restraint Rules
- Do not chain multiple connectors to reconstruct info that already exists locally.
- Do not escalate from one blocked connector to another unless external verification is truly required.
- If connector fails and local context is available, proceed from local context.
- Do not use live deployment/browser/API tools to infer code when local source files exist.
- Use the most direct tool available and stop once enough context is available.

### Project Skills
Use project skills when they directly match the task. Avoid overlapping skill sprawl.

Local repo skills:
- `darling-martech-seo` — service/page SEO, metadata, linking strategy, taxonomy, GEO/AI-search structure.
- `darling-martech-labs` — `/lab` structure, categorization, service-linking, lab-vs-work mapping.
- `darling-martech-data` — analytics, attribution, reporting, KPI/measurement planning.
- `darling-martech-services` — service architecture, parent/child design, packaging, intent-led service pages.
- `darling-martech-copy` — messaging, headlines, CTAs, trust/conversion copy.
- `darling-martech-ui` — interface, layout, hierarchy, conversion-focused visual structure.
- `darling-martech-redesign` — audit and cleanup for AI-looking or inconsistent UI patterns.

Optional skills (use only if present in the active runtime):
- `darling-website-content`
- `workspace-organizer`
- `file-organizer`
- `industrial-brutalist-ui`
- `name-frontend-design`

### Default Behavior by Task Type
For code edits:
1. local repo files
2. relevant docs
3. relevant project skill if needed

Do not start with Vercel or Chrome.

For content strategy:
1. project docs
2. memory files (if present)
3. service/copy/content skills

For service architecture:
1. service docs
2. taxonomy docs
3. `darling-martech-services`
4. `darling-martech-seo` when needed

For `/work` and `/lab` mapping:
1. taxonomy docs
2. local content/data files
3. `darling-martech-labs`
4. `darling-martech-services`

For live verification:
- use Vercel or Chrome only when user explicitly asks for live-state confirmation

### Operating Rule Summary
- Local repo first
- Docs and memory second
- Skills third
- Connectors only when necessary
- Live verification only when explicitly requested
- Smallest effective action
- No unnecessary retries
- No multi-tool reconstruction when local truth exists

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16+ App Router | RSC default. `"use client"` only for interactive/animated/3D components |
| Styling | **CSS Modules + CSS custom properties only** | Zero Tailwind colors/typography. Tailwind removed entirely for visual styling |

### Styling rule — CSS Modules ONLY for visual properties
Tailwind is **removed** from all visual styling. Every color, typography,
surface, animation, and visual property uses CSS Modules + CSS custom properties.

```
✅ Allowed (layout only):  grid  flex  col-span-2  container  mx-auto
❌ Never use:              bg-*  text-*  border-*  shadow-*  rounded-*
                           font-*  tracking-*  transition-*  animate-*
```

> **Gotcha:** `tailwind.config.ts` remains for shadcn token infrastructure. Rule:
> no Tailwind for visual styling (colors, typography, shadows). Layout utilities
> and shadcn plumbing are still Tailwind-backed.

### 3D components rule

All Three.js/R3F components MUST:

- Be lazy-loaded with `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })` — Three.js is browser-only
- Use `React.memo` or minimal re-render patterns
- Accept mouse position via `ref` (not state) to avoid React re-renders
- Target 60fps — never run heavy geometry inside `useFrame` without memoization

### Motion hierarchy

1. **Framer Motion** — React component animations, hover, entrance, spring physics
2. **GSAP ScrollTrigger** — scroll-sequenced timelines via `useScrollAnimation` hook
3. **Three.js `useFrame`** — per-frame 3D transforms (rotation, drift, camera rig)
4. **CSS** — only `transition: border-color` for hover state color changes

---

## Brand Identity

### CSS Custom Properties (copy these into globals.css)
```css
:root {
  --color-base:           #0A0A0A;  /* Primary background */
  --color-surface:        #141414;  /* Elevated cards, drawers */
  --color-surface-raised: #1A1A1A;  /* Modals, tooltips */
  --color-accent:         #FF4D00;  /* Electric Orange — use sparingly */
  --color-text:           #F5F0E8;  /* Warm Off-White — primary text */
  --color-muted:          #888888;  /* Secondary/body text */
  --color-border:         rgba(245, 240, 232, 0.08);  /* Hairline borders */
  --color-border-accent:  rgba(255, 77, 0, 0.3);      /* Hover accent borders */

  --font-display: 'Cabinet Grotesk', sans-serif;
  --font-body:    'Inter', sans-serif;
  --font-accent:  'Instrument Serif', serif;

  /* Spring physics presets for Framer Motion */
  --spring-standard:  /* stiffness: 120, damping: 20 */
  --spring-entrance:  /* stiffness: 80,  damping: 18 */
  --spring-cinematic: /* stiffness: 55,  damping: 16 */
}
```

### Color System
| Name | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Obsidian | #0A0A0A | Primary background — true near-black |
| Electric Orange | #FF4D00 | Brand accent — used sparingly (1–2× per section max) |
| Warm Off-White | #F5F0E8 | Text on dark, light backgrounds |
| Mid Gray | #888888 | Supporting/secondary text |
| Surface | #141414 | Cards, elevated sections |

### Typography
- **Display/Headlines:** Cabinet Grotesk — weight 700–900, tracking
  -0.02em to -0.04em, tight line-height ~0.95–1.1
- **Body:** Inter — weight 400, line-height 1.6–1.7, color #888888 on dark bg,
  `max-width: 65ch`
- **Accent:** Instrument Serif — italic only, emotional moments only
  (never in nav, UI, or data contexts)
- **Data/numbers:** `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`
- **Headings:** `text-wrap: balance` to prevent widows

### Logo
- Wordmark: "Darling" in #F5F0E8 + "MarTech" in #FF4D00 — Cabinet
  Grotesk Bold
- Monogram: "DM" mark for favicon, social avatars, compact use
- SVG files: `/public/images/logo/`

### Brand Photo
- Primary: `jacob-bio-photo-splash.jpg` — artistic watercolor treatment
- Location: `/public/images/`

---

## Framer Motion — Required Patterns

### Spring presets (define these once, import everywhere)
```ts
// lib/motion.ts
export const springStandard  = { type: "spring", stiffness: 120, damping: 20 }
export const springEntrance  = { type: "spring", stiffness: 80,  damping: 18 }
export const springCinematic = { type: "spring", stiffness: 55,  damping: 16 }

export const containerVariants = {
  hidden: {},
  visible: { transition: { staggerChildren: 0.07, delayChildren: 0.05 } }
}

export const itemVariants = {
  hidden:  { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: springEntrance }
}
```

### Rules
- All sections use `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-80px" }}`
- Every `motion.*` component that animates must be a `"use client"` component
- No `transition: all 0.3s ease` anywhere in CSS — use Framer Motion instead
- Stagger delay: 60–100ms (tighter feels mechanical)
- Only animate `transform` and `opacity` — never layout properties
- Hover: `whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}` on cards; `whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}` on buttons

## 21st.dev Component Library

These are pre-vetted drop-in components from 21st.dev. Install via shadcn CLI.
**All require brand adaptation** — see adaptation rules below.

| Component | Purpose | Install URL |
|---|---|---|
| Hero ASCII (reapollo) | Left-aligned dark hero + geometric illustration right | `https://21st.dev/community/components/reapollo/hero-ascii/default` |
| Background Paths (kokonutd) | Animated wire path background at 15–20% opacity | `https://21st.dev/community/components/kokonutd/background-paths/default` |
| Grid Card (efferd) | Dark surface + animated grid pattern + gradient hover | `https://21st.dev/community/components/efferd/grid-card/default` |
| Button Colorful (kokonutd) | Directional hover fill from left + arrow icon | `https://21st.dev/community/components/kokonutd/button-colorful/default` |
| Underline Animation (danielpetho) | 3 Framer-powered variants for nav/footer links | `https://21st.dev/community/components/danielpetho/underline-animation/default` |

Install command pattern:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/[component-url]"
```

### Brand adaptation rules (apply to EVERY 21st.dev component after install)
1. **Colors** — Replace all purple/blue/gradient with `var(--color-accent)`,
   `var(--color-base)`, `var(--color-text)`, `var(--color-muted)`
2. **Icons** — Swap `lucide-react` → `@phosphor-icons/react` with `weight="light"`
3. **Fonts** — Replace any font-family with `var(--font-display)` for headings,
   `var(--font-body)` for paragraphs
4. **Tailwind colors** — Move to CSS Modules; keep only layout utilities
5. **Motion** — If component uses CSS transitions, upgrade to Framer Motion
   spring physics using the presets in `lib/motion.ts`

---

## Design Principles

### The standard
The site should look like it was built by a senior human designer who spent
time on it — not generated from a template or AI prompt. Every layout
decision should have a visible reason. No pattern should appear just because
it's the default.

### Layout rules
- Dark background (#0A0A0A) always — never light gray or navy as base
- One accent color (Electric Orange) — intentional and sparingly placed
- Strong typographic scale — huge display text + small refined body text
- **Asymmetric layouts** — break the grid deliberately; never equal columns
  as the primary feature layout
- Hero is always left-aligned (or split-screen) — never centered text
  over a dark background
- Generous whitespace — let content breathe
- `min-height: 100dvh` on full-height sections — never `height: 100vh`
- `max-width: 1400px` container on all pages
- Complex layouts use CSS Grid — not flexbox percentage math
- Below 768px: all asymmetric layouts collapse to single column, no
  horizontal scroll

### Motion rules
- Scroll-triggered via `whileInView` — purposeful, not decorative
- Subtle hover micro-interactions on all interactive elements
- No instant state changes — all transitions spring-interpolated
- No animations on layout properties (width, height, top, left)

### Strictly avoid
- Purple-to-blue gradients on any element
- Glowing orbs or blob background shapes
- Glassmorphism / frosted blur cards
- Floating particle or confetti animations
- Generic symmetrical 3-column card grids as primary feature layout
- Overly rounded "bubbly" UI (`border-radius` max 16px for cards)
- Centered hero text over dark background
- `text-gradient` CSS on headings
- Generic white card + gray border + drop shadow pattern
- Any aesthetic that reads as AI-generated or template-built

### Card pattern (required)
```css
.card {
  background: var(--color-surface);
  border: 1px solid var(--color-border);
  border-radius: 16px;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: border-color 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
}
.card:hover {
  border-color: var(--color-border-accent);
}
```

---

## Brand Voice & Tone
**We are:** Confident and direct. Strategic and outcomes-focused.
Tech-fluent and clear. Personal and approachable.

**We are not:** Corporate or stiff. Salesy or pushy. Vague or full of
buzzwords. Overly trendy. Generic.

Every word should sound like Jacob speaking directly to a potential
client — not like an agency website. "I", not "we". Present tense.
Outcome-first (what did it unlock?) not tool-first.

### Copy anti-patterns (purge on sight)
| Found | Replace with |
|---|---|
| "Elevate your..." | Direct verb: "Build your...", "Grow your..." |
| "Seamless experience" | Describe what actually happens |
| "Unleash the power of" | Delete. State the outcome. |
| "Next-generation" | Specific technology name |
| "Game-changer" | Specific result stat |
| "Our team of experts" | "Me. Directly. No hand-offs." |
| Round numbers (50%, $100) | Real numbers from this brief |
| Exclamation marks | Confident, calm confirmation instead |

- Deployed: gated locally — no external URL needed

### Local HTML lab tools (legacy)
These are legacy standalone files that are now surfaced through work case studies and redirects, not the current `/tools` primary utility surface:
- `/public/labs/clinical-compass/` — Graston Clinical Compass Tool.html
- `/public/labs/investment-roi-planner/` — Investment ROI Planner Tool.html
- `/public/labs/smart-sales-pricing/` — Graston Smart Sales and Pricing Tool.html
- `/public/labs/license-requirements/` — Practitioner License Requirements Tool.html

### Lab card visual modes (per entry in `data/labs.ts`)
Each lab entry includes `screenshots[]` with Cloudinary URLs for the detail page.

### Current lab launch pattern for lead-gen tools
Same-tab modal launch from `/lab` where strategically appropriate; detail pages can still exist for deep links / "Read the build".

### CTA-discipline note for tool placement
Do not overuse tool CTAs; one relevant tool CTA per page max; use tools only where they fit naturally.

## Services — Architecture Detail

### `/services` runtime model (updated 2026-03-29)
`/services` is organized around **4 buyer-problem clusters**. The old "Strategy / Build / Growth" three-layer framing is **no longer the runtime model**.

Runtime structure of `ServicesExperience.tsx`:
1. **Hero** — problem-led intro ("The work usually starts in one of four places.") + dual CTA
2. **4 cluster sections** — each with icon, label, problem statement, body copy, child-service links, and one proof anchor
3. **Final CTA** — `/contact?intent=service`

The old layer-selector cards (`serviceLayerMeta`), "Productized offers" section (`standaloneServicePages`), and flat proof strip have been removed. `ServicesExperience.tsx` no longer imports `serviceLayerMeta` or `standaloneServicePages`.

**4 runtime clusters:**
- Strategy & Leadership — routes to: `fractional-cmo`, `brand-strategy` (positioning/messaging), `martech-audit` (audit & roadmap)
- Websites, UX & Brand — routes to: `website-strategy`, `conversion-optimization`, `brand-strategy` (brand identity systems)
- CRM, Automation & AI — routes to: `crm-architecture`, `agentic-marketing-systems`, `martech-audit`
- Growth, SEO & Demand — routes to: `local-seo`, `conversion-optimization`, `geo-optimization` (canonical service slug; resolves to nested `/services/growth/geo-optimization`)

**`/services` page role:** explains problem clusters, routes users to child-service pages, supports each cluster with one proof anchor. It does not sell every sub-service in depth — that is child-service pages' job.

**Data exports still in `data/services.ts` (not all are used by the index page):**
- `serviceOverview` — 4 summary cards (used by homepage `Services` component)
- `serviceDetails` — 6 full service entries with deliverables + proof (used by `/services/[slug]`)
- `serviceLayerMeta` — three-layer meta (not used by `/services` runtime; kept for slug page use)
- `specializedServices` — 8 specialty service items
- `engagementModels` — 3 engagement types
- `contactServiceOptions` — 7 options for the contact form select
- `standaloneServicePages` — standalone offer pages (not used by `/services` runtime)

**3D scene targets** in `serviceDetails` (`sceneTarget` field):
`strategy-core`, `build-brand-web`, `build-systems`, `growth-core`, `build-commerce`, `build-specialized`
These tie to the `ServicesAmbient` 3D scene component on individual service detail pages.

**Layered writing rule** still governs all service work:
1. Plain-English buyer language first
2. Strategic translator language second
3. Technical/specialist language third (lower on child pages, not at index level)

> **Service-page docs:** Full planning set in `docs/context/project/service-pages/` — tracker,
> slug conventions, proof matrix, copy decks, page template, and briefs. Consult before
> any `/services` or child-page work.

## Component Architecture — Key Components

### 3D Components (`components/3d/`)
- `HeroBackground.tsx` — Three.js hero scene (lazy-loaded, SSR disabled)
- `LabTelemetryScene.tsx` — Lab page 3D scene
- `ServicesAmbient.tsx` — Services page ambient 3D
- `WorkAmbient.tsx` — Work page ambient 3D
- `FloatingCard.tsx` — 3D card tilt effect
- `system/` — System/reusable 3D utilities
- `scene-types.ts` — Shared scene type definitions

### Interactive Components (`components/interactive/`)
- `CursorSpotlight.tsx` — Cursor-following spotlight effect
- `MagneticButton.tsx` — Magnetic hover effect on CTAs

### Motion Components (`components/motion/`)
- `KineticHeadline.tsx` — Animated headline component
- `ClientTicker.tsx` — Client logo ticker/marquee
- `StatCounter.tsx` — Animated number counter
- `index.ts` — Re-exports

### Layout Components (`components/layout/`)
- `Nav.tsx` + `Nav.module.css` — Floating pill nav
- `Footer.tsx` + `Footer.module.css`

### Section Components (`components/sections/`)
- `Hero.tsx` — Homepage hero
- `Services.tsx` — Services overview section
- `CaseStudies.tsx` — Homepage proof teaser: horizontal rail of a fixed showcase
  list, minimal prev/next + link to `/work` (no signal bar or progress UI; rail
  scroll uses the track only, aligned with the work index editorial pattern).
  Accessibility: `aria-live` announces the active slide; the rail is a focusable
  `region` with Arrow Left/Right and Home/End to change slides; prev/next icons
  are `aria-hidden` (labels on buttons).
- Work index `WorkStudioCarousel`: studio filter uses tab ids + `tabpanel` wiring,
  arrow keys move between tabs; lightbox is `role="dialog"` with initial focus
  on close, `Escape` and overlay click dismiss, body scroll locked while open,
  focus returns to the thumb that opened it; close control has a visible
  `:focus-visible` ring.
- Work index `WorkGrid` / `WorkSubNav`: same tablist pattern as the studio strip —
  stable tab `id`s, `aria-controls` on each tab pointing at the filtered results
  `tabpanel`, roving `tabIndex`, Arrow Left/Right to change segment; panel uses
  `aria-labelledby` for the active tab.
- `CmoAccessModal`: on open, focus moves to the name field when the form phase is
  shown; on close, focus returns to the element that had focus before open.
- `CaseStudyContent.tsx` / `CaseStudyImages.tsx` — Work detail sections
- `AboutTeaser.tsx` — About teaser component (not rendered on homepage as of 2026-03-29; available for `/about` or other future use)
- `Testimonials.tsx` — Testimonials section
- `ContactCTA.tsx` — Contact CTA section
- `ContactForm.tsx` — Contact form (React Hook Form + Zod)
- `FeaturedTool.tsx` / `FeaturedToolInner.tsx` — Lab featured tool
- `StudioGallery.tsx` — Cloudinary gallery
- `CareerTimeline/` — About page career timeline
- `WorkDetail/` — Work detail page components
- `WorkIndex/` — Work index page components

### Lab Components (`components/lab/`)
- `LabDetailPage.tsx` — Lab tool detail layout
- `LabModal.tsx` — Lab tool iframe modal: on open, focus moves to the close
  control; on close, focus restores to the prior active element; `Escape` and
  overlay click still close; body scroll locked while open; close button has a
  visible `:focus-visible` ring.
- `CmoAccessModal.tsx` — CMO Simulator access gate

### UI Components (`components/ui/`)
- `background-paths.tsx` — 21st.dev background paths (adapted)
- `button-colorful.tsx` — 21st.dev button colorful (adapted)
- `grid-card.tsx` — 21st.dev grid card (adapted)
- `underline-animation.tsx` — 21st.dev underline animation (adapted)
- `gallery-hover-card.tsx` — Studio gallery hover card
- `masonry-grid.tsx` — Masonry layout grid
- `ScrollProgress.tsx` — Scroll progress indicator
- `CookieConsent.tsx` — Cookie consent banner
- `BackToTop.tsx` — Back to top button

### Provider Components (`components/providers/`)
- `LenisProvider.tsx` — Smooth scroll provider
- `Analytics.tsx` — Analytics tracking

### Custom Hooks (`hooks/`)
- `useCursorFollow.ts` — Cursor position tracking
- `useFinePointer.ts` — Fine pointer detection
- `useMagneticEffect.ts` — Magnetic button effect
- `useReducedMotion.ts` — Reduced motion preference
- `useScrollAnimation.ts` — GSAP scroll animation
- `useScrollDirection.ts` — Scroll direction detection
- `useTypingEffect.ts` — Typing animation

---

## Canonical Slug Rules

Several case study slugs were renamed. These are the canonical slugs:
- `riley-bennett-egloff` (not rbe-law)
- `primarycare-indy` (not primary-care-indy)
- `urgentcare-indy` (not urgent-care-indy)
- `317-bbq` (not three-seventeen-bbq)

Redirects live in `next.config.js`.

---

## Asset Infrastructure

### Cloudinary
- Cloud name: `djhqowk67`
- Use Cloudinary Next.js SDK for all project/studio images
- Reference images by public ID, not local path
- Studio gallery pulls from Cloudinary folders:
  `/studio/photography/`
  `/studio/graphic-design/`
  `/studio/proof/`

### Cloudinary image reference pattern
```ts
// Use public ID, not full URL, in data files
logoPublicId: 'graston_technique_logo'
heroPublicId: 'PMC-Dr.-Pike-Xray'
cardPublicId: 'primary-care-indy-website'

// Cloudinary URL pattern for screenshots in data/labs.ts:
src: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/djhqowk67/image/upload/w_1400,f_auto,q_auto/[public-id].png'
```

### Fonts
- Cabinet Grotesk: already in `/public/fonts/cabinet-grotesk/` (woff2 files)
- Loaded via `next/font` `localFont` in `app/layout.tsx`

### Environment Variables
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — contact form email delivery (configured in .env.local + Vercel)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=djhqowk67`

### Phase 3 — Planned
- [ ] `/pricing` page (after content session)
- [ ] Blog infrastructure (MDX)

---

## Content Sessions Still Needed
1. Pricing — define service tiers before building page
2. Services — expand each service page with process steps if needed

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev    # Development server on localhost:3000
npm run build  # Production build
npm run lint   # ESLint
```

**Build gotcha:** If `npm run build` fails with "generate is not a function",
a conflicting shell env var is set from another Next.js project:

```bash
__NEXT_PRIVATE_STANDALONE_CONFIG="" npm run build
```

---

## Gotchas & Known Issues

- **Tailwind NOT fully removed** — `tailwind.config.ts` remains for shadcn token infrastructure. Visual styling must use CSS Modules.
- **`next/image` is `unoptimized: true`** — current project setting; do not assume Next.js image optimization is enabled.
- **Slug renames** — Canonical slugs: `riley-bennett-egloff`, `primarycare-indy`, `urgentcare-indy`. Redirects in `next.config.js`.
- **`lucide-react` in package.json** — Still listed but unused. Use `@phosphor-icons/react` only.
- **Lab content in `data/labs.ts`** — The three active tool entries are data-driven from `LAB_DETAIL_DATA`; legacy lab pages are now handled by redirects and work-case-study routes.
- **CMO Simulator access** — Gated via `CmoAccessModal` + `/api/cmo-simulator-access`. SessionStorage bypass for returning visitors.
- **WorkAmbient + ServicesAmbient** — Both use `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })`. If adding new 3D scenes, follow same pattern.
- **`case-studies/` directory** — Contains raw markdown research files, NOT used by the app. App reads from `data/work/work-data.ts`.
- **`.worktrees/`** — Keep this directory out of the repo root unless an active local worktree is intentionally being used.
- **`docs/archive/outputs/marketing-strategy-service.md`** — Archived research artifact. Not used by app.
